# MTC-LoGANv2-CNN
This is a repository for scripts used in the manuscript "Deep Semi-Supervised Learning Using Generative Adversarial Networks for Automated Seismic Facies Classification of Mass Transport Complex .", submitted to Computers and Geosciences.

The framework proposed in this paper contains two major componements, known as the LoGANv2 for the augmentation of mass transport complex and CNN for the classification of Mass Transport Complex facies. 

## LoGANv2
Implementation of LoGANv2 is based on the open-source code published by [Oeldorf and Spanakis, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09974). 

The github repository for LoGANv2 is listed as https://github.com/cedricoeldorf/ConditionalStyleGAN. 

### Set-up
```
To run the code, an NVIDIA QUADRO P5000 video card with 8GB video memory is required.

Software development environment should be any Python integrated development environment used on an NVIDIA video card.

Programming language: Python 3.6.

Tensorflow-gpu == 1.15.1

Tensorflow == 1.19
